Downloading, converting, and scanning PDF files from cityofomaha.org for TIF information.

[Click here to view final output](https://github.com/opennebraska/tif/tree/main/cityofomaha.org/tif_pretty)

Software:

- scraper.pl - Pulls PDF files from cityofomaha.org into our own repository.
- makepretty.pl - Scans text versions of the PDF files, finding occurrences of TIF.

Archive (as of Feb 27 2017):

- Nov 4 2008 through February 14 2017.
- 362 .pdf files totaling 96MB in our repository.
- None of the data files sit in github.com. The PDF and text files [are sitting in Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lb1kwtfou7b2kg4/AACAZrrrBOnzRUmgK6ek14a1a?dl=0).

The `scraper.pl` program now pulls an incomplete list because cityofomaha.org
requires a Javascript client for some reason. Patches welcome!

Download the PDFs, convert them to text, and spit out the "pretty TIF only"
markdown formatted file like so:

```
mkdir dump
scraper.pl
cd dump
ls *pdf | xargs -L 1 pdftotext -nopgbrk
cd ..
makepretty.pl
```
